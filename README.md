# AI-Powered-Virtual-Assistant
The provided code is for a voice-activated assistant application in Python, designed to perform a variety of tasks based on voice commands. Key Python libraries are utilized: pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, allowing the assistant to speak, speech_recognition for interpreting spoken words, datetime for accessing current time, wikipedia for fetching summaries from Wikipedia, webbrowser for opening web pages, os for file and directory operations, and smtplib for sending emails. The assistant, whimsically named "batman", is initialized with a specific voice setting using the SAPI5 speech API. It contains a speak function to vocalize text and a wishMe function to greet the user based on the time of day.

The assistant's functionality is driven by the takeCommand function, which captures and processes spoken words into text using Google's speech recognition service. The main function contains the logic for executing tasks based on the interpreted commands. For instance, if the user mentions 'wikipedia', the assistant searches for the term on Wikipedia and reads out a summary. It can also open websites like YouTube and Google, but requires the user to specify the browser's path in the code. The script can play music from a predefined directory, tell the current time, or open a specified code editor or application. Moreover, it includes an email feature, where it can send emails with user-dictated content, though it requires proper configuration of the sender's email details. Overall, the code integrates various functionalities into a single voice-activated assistant, aimed at enhancing user convenience through hands-free control over basic tasks like web browsing, listening to music, or managing emails.
